styling and code quality are important for a number of reasons:

    Having consistent and clean code makes you look like a better coder. Many companies have issues with technical debt. If you are looking to get hired, they want engineers that wonâ€™t exacerbate that problem.
    When code is more readable it speeds up the development process. Once the brain gets used to code formatted a certain way, it becomes much easier to figure what is going on.
    Best practices enforced by code-quality increase performance. Javascript can do some weird stuff. It is the wild west of code languages. Let a linter take care of that headache.


run following command

    npm install --save-dev eslint prettier husky lint-staged
    npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb
    npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
    npm audit fix


Update your package.json like this:

package.json

{
  "scripts": {
    "precommit": "lint-staged"
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.js": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "jest --bail --findRelatedTests",
      "prettier --write",
      "git add"
    ],
    "*.scss": ["stylelint --fix", "prettier --write", "git add"]
  }
}


This configuration will perform the following steps:

Every time you commit a .js file:

    Run ESLint with autofixing on files you are committing.
    Run Jest tests related to files you are committing.
    Format files you are committing with Prettier.
    Add changes caused by autofixing and reformatting to your commit.

Every time you commit an .scss file:

    Run stylelint with autofixing on files you are committing.
    Format files you are committing with Prettier.
    Add changes caused by reformatting to your commit.
